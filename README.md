   - Adjust based on your specific workflow
   - Test accessibility by walking through virtually

3. **Safety Check**
   - Verify 36" walkways are maintained
   - Check weight distribution on shelves
   - Ensure chemical separation from heat sources

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Export the final layout as PDF
   - Create labels for all storage units
   - Physically reorganize following the plan

5. **Maintenance Phase**
   - Review layout quarterly
   - Update app with new tools
   - Adjust based on usage patterns

### Advanced Features

#### **Collaboration Mode**
- Share layouts with family members
